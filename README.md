# Overview

AfyaMind is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that focuses on detecting emotions expressed in text.
In today’s digital environment, understanding the emotions embedded in written communication is essential for supporting mental health initiatives, social research, and digital wellness platforms.
By classifying user text into emotion categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise, AfyaMind aims to improve emotional awareness and provide data-driven insights to help organizations respond empathetically and effectively.
